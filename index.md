## About us

We are London's community for developers and users of Python data tools.

Run by volunteers, PyData London provides Python enthusiasts a place to share
ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply the language and tools
to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing,
analytics and visualisation. We run **monthly events on the first Tuesday of
each month**, in addition to **annual conferences**. We aim to provide a venue
for users across all the various domains of data analysis to share their
experiences and their techniques, as well as highlight the triumphs and
potential pitfalls of using Python.
